To start the development of my code, I used the lab1 as a basis of how to use an API in node.
I then changed it to work with the frankfurter API.
I also had to spice up the css alot, since I wanted to increase the creativity.
I want to make it clear that I used to chatgpt to check some of my answers, and do some error fixing.
I wasn't sure if this was required if you use AI, but if you want my chat logs I can provide.
It was also unclear whether AI was totally allowed, but I wanted to include this, so I wasn't feeling like I was hiding something.
