When I was originally starting this lab, I was unsure of how I was going to find 2-3 API's applicable with my subject.
The only thing I could possibly think of was the spotify API, obviously to display and possibly play the songs.
Then I realized that genius has an API.
Genius is an app which mainly displays songs lyrics, and gives background information about the a song and it's lyrics.
At the end of the day the genius anbd spotify implementations exist, but they are not as functional as I would like them to be yet.
In the future I will work to make the implementations more functional and useful.
