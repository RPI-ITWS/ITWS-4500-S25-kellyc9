When I was originally starting this lab, I was unsure of how I was going to find 2-3 API's applicable with my subject.
The only thing I could possibly think of was the spotify API, obviously to display and possibly play the songs.
Then I realized that genius has an API.
Genius is an app which mainly displays songs lyrics, and gives background information about the a song and it's lyrics.
The goal of this was to display a play button, which would take you to the spotify link of the song, and a lyrics link, which would take you to the genius link of each song.
There are currently issues with some songs, which if the song does not exist on spotify it gives a different song.
